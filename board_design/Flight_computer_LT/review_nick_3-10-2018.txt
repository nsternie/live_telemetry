Notes:

FT230: No critical items. Only things to address are items 2 and 3.
1.  Might be a good idea to add a ferrite bead from USB shield to ground
2.  App note has 27 ohm in series on usb datalines, schematic shows 0
3.  App note also suggests more caps, extra 100n and 4.7u.
4.  Not sure how diode to VIN works? Will the drop be too high for the reg?
5.  Pins match datasheet.
6.  Package seems correct, cannot verify footprint with no digi-key libriary.

SX1280:
1. Pins names and numbers match datasheet.
2. Datasheet notes typical oscillator at 52MHz, schematic is 24MHz, is that ok?
3. Schematic matched application notes. Values on passives in RF signal path match app note.
4. Package/footprint is correct.
